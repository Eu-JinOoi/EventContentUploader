# EventContentUploader

## Background/Purpose
At national and international scouting events, the content team is out in the field. There is not an easy way to get content back to people to edit and post the content without the content creator returning back to the headquarters. In some event venues, you may end up miles away from headquarters with the only mode of transportation being your two legs. This project is an attempt to make it so content creators can upload content in the field simply by plugging a memory card in. 

## Design
The current design is to upload the images to an album on Flickr with limited visibility so that only the the content team can see the content, allowing for review before being available to the public.
